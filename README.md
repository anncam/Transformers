## **Do vision transformers see like convolutional neural networks?**

### Problem 

How do Vision Transformers (ViT) perform image classification tasks? How is it different from the way Convolutional Neural Networks perform image classification?

Goal is to understand the differences between ViTs and CNNs in relation to image tasks. 

### Approach
- Looked at the representation structures of ViTs and CNNs 
- Analyzed use of global and local spatial information
- 

#### Prior research
